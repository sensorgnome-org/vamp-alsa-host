/*
   vamp-alsa-host was originally intended to read from one or more
   funcubedongle radio receivers, process the signal through a VAMP
   plugin, and write the features found by the plugin to one or more
   socket

   The funcubedongle streams baseband I/Q output as stereo USB audio
   at 96ksps in S16_LE format.  Due to apparent quirks in the
   funcubedongle and/or the USB implementation on the beaglebone
   computer where this code was first deployed, vamp-alsa-host
   provides the ability to stop and restart each device independently,
   so that device settings such as VHF frequency can be changed.  These
   settings are sent to a USB HID interface on the funcubedongle, and
   attempting to do so while the device is streaming audio is
   unreliable, at least on the beaglebone + USB hub platform.

   Each line of output is prepended with the label for its
   funcubedongle.  Audio data is read using alsa and poll(), and we
   try to provide real timestamps.  On the bonedongle (i.e. beaglebone
   + funcubedongle), timestamp precision appears to be around 1ms or
   less.

   FIXME:
   Sample format is hard-coded as S16_LE to match the funcubedongle.
